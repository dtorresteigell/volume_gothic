Abstract:
We calculate the Masur-Veech volume of the gothic locus G in the stratum H(2,2,2) of genus four. Our method is based on the use of the formulae for the Euler characteristics of gothic Teichm√ºller curves to determine the number of lattice points of given area. We also use this method to recalculate the Masur-Veech volumes of the Prym loci P_3 inside H(4) and P_4 inside H(6) in genus three and four.
